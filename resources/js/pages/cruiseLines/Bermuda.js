                    <p className="mt-2 text-lg break-words indent-4">
                        One of the biggest benefits of cruising to Bermuda is
                        the amount of flexibility it allows you. If you’re like
                        many people, you’re probably more comfortable taking a
                        cruise than boarding a plane. A cruise is also an
                        excellent way to spend time with family members, whether
                        they are young or old. Not only does a cruise offer you
                        flexibility, but it also allows you to explore new
                        destinations without the stress of having to pack. While
                        cruising, you’ll have access to your own stateroom,
                        including a closet where you can store your belongings.
                        Cruises also offer plenty of amenities, including
                        on-board shopping, ample dining options, and plenty of
                        entertainment. Additionally, cruises to Bermuda provide
                        plenty of opportunities for you to learn more about your
                        destination. On every cruise, there will be an onboard
                        expert that can walk you through the history and culture
                        of the island. Not only will you learn more about
                        Bermuda, but you’ll also have plenty of engaging topics
                        of conversation with other passengers on board.

                        like, and cruise lines will arrange excursions from the
