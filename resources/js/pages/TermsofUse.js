                <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-3 mb-1'>Collection of personal information</h2>
                <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you make a purchase through the Website. Currently this is limited to your email address, which is required for you to be able to login to the Website and access any purchased koyap UI products. </p>
                <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-3 mb-1'>Collection of non-personal information</h2>
                <p>When you visit the Website our servers automatically record information that your browser sends. This data may include information such as your device's IP address, browser type and version, operating system type and version, language preferences or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website, pages of our Website that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Website, access times and dates, and other statistics.</p>
                <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-3 mb-1'>Purchases</h2>
                <p>All purchases made through the Website are processed by a third party payment processor, Paddle (<a href="https://paddle.com">paddle.com</a>). Paddle may ask you for personal and/or non-personal information, such as your name, address, email address, credit card information, or other Personal Information. Paddle has a privacy policy (<a href="https://paddle.com/legal-buyers/">paddle.com/legal-buyers/</a>) that describes their collection and use of personal information. koyap does not control Paddle or its collection or use of information. Any questions or concerns about Paddle’s practices should be directed to Paddle. </p>
                <p>Paddle provides us with certain non-personal information relating to purchases made by visitors to the Website. The non-personal information may include details of the purchase such as the date, amount paid, and product purchased. The non-personal purchase information may be linked to the Personal Information you provide to us (typically limited to your email address, as stated above). Paddle does not supply us with any of your other Personal Information such as your name, street address, or credit card information.</p>
                <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-3 mb-1'>Managing personal information</h2>
                <p>You are able to update your Personal Information in your "Account Settings" on the Website. Currently this is limited to just your email address, as described above. You may also request that we delete your email address, but this will prevent you from accessing the products you have purchased from koyap. </p>
                <p>When you update information, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. Some information may remain in our private records after deletion of such information from your account for a retention period. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, your rights to access, add to, and update your information cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>
                <p>We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. </p>
                <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-3 mb-1'>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
                <p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used to personalize your experience; improve our Website; improve customer service; process transactions; send notification emails such as password reminders, updates, etc; and operate our Website. Non-Personal Information collected is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding Website usage. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.</p>
                <p>We may process Personal Information related to you if one of the following applies: (i) You have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to European data protection law; (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (ii) Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>
                <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-3 mb-1'>Information transfer and storage</h2>
                <p>Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your information.

                <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-3 mb-1'>The right to object to processing</h2>
                <p>Where Personal Information is processed for a public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection.

                <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-3 mb-1'>Information security</h2>
                <p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and our Website cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third-party, despite best efforts.</p>
                <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-3 mb-1'>Data breach</h2>
                <p>In the event we become aware that the security of the Website has been compromised or users’ Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third-parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do we will send you an email.</p>
                <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mt-3 mb-1'>Legal disclosure</h2>
                <p>We will disclose any information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger or acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your user account and personal data will likely be among the assets transferred.</p>
